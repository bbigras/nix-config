# nix-config ![CI](https://github.com/bbigras/nix-config/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

WIP

This is heavily based on https://github.com/lovesegfault/nix-config. Many files were copied directly from that repo.

Note that the license should include lovesegfault's copyright on many files. Not sure how to sort that yet.
