  # Configuration for which interfaces multicast peer discovery should be

  # contain Regex, Beacon, Listen, and Port. Regex is a regular expression
  # which is matched against an interface name, and interfaces use the
  # first configuration that they match gainst. Beacon configures whether
  # or not the node should send link-local multicast beacons to advertise
  # their presence, while listening for incoming connections on Port.
  # Listen controls whether or not the node listens for multicast beacons
  # and opens outgoing connections.
